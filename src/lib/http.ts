/**
 * Execute fetch with additional options, inlcuding retries and timeout
 *
 * @param url: URL to call
 * @param o FetchOptions: options to pass to fetch, including retries and timeout
 *
 * @todo:
 * - implement retries flow: when the request fails, the retry flow is executed.
 *    When attempts are exhausted, the entire process should result into failure
 *    by keeping the original error
 * - timeout flow: when the response is not received within the timeout,
 *    the request is aborted, and the retry flow is executed
 *
 * You can find an example of usage at `src/app/fetch/pages.tsx`
 * It makes an API call to /api/mayfail, which may fail over calls and duration varies from 0 to 2 seconds
 *
 * So for better testing, you can change the `retries` and `timeout` values to have a value under 2 seconds
 *
 * @param url
 * @param o
 * @returns
